# Q-Learning

This was Unviersity Coursework that has been preovously submitted and shows my learning as obviously much of this can be improved. This task was undertaken alone.

The Spaceship File is a game I designed based on what we had been taught and the parameters set by the task.

The Q-Learning file contain the code for Q-Learning which is used to try and beat the game consistently.
The parameters currently set in the code are nto those used to achieve the best results
